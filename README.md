##Redbox Browser Notification Extensions

This is a simple chrome extension that notifies you when selected movies are available at selected kiosks.

###Notes

This was an experiment for the most part in using coffeescript to generate an extension. It also uses browser notifications and mustache.js templates.

You will need coffeescript to compile this extenssion. You will also need to put a copy of <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery 1.7</a> and <a href="http://mustache.github.com/">mustache.js</a> into the chrome directory for it to work as well.
